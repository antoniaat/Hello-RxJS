# Hello RxJS

_This repository represents a demo page for one of my talks - the topic is **Hello RxJS**, and as you can imagine it's an introductory lecture for this wonderful library._

### Important!

Here you will not find copy-pasted documentation but simple **examples** with the most popular RxJS pipeable operators!

These examples are into a **React** app, so if you want to see how the reactive programming looks or you just need to understand how some operator works, feel free to clone it and take a look.

### List of the operators which you will find here:

*Each operator is demonstated on separate file so if you don't want to download the whole project you can open the one you need*
